# To launch run the following command from the directory containing this file:
#     kubectl create -f vit-bot-pro.yaml
# Make sure to set the credentials of the bot accordingly.
# Only one copy of the bot can run at a time on one account!
# You can set the room the bot is in by manually logging in as the bot on KGS,
# and navigating to the room you want the bot to be in. When the bot reconnects
# it will join the room you were in.
