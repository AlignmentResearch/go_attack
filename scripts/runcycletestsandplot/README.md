Tests models on several cyclic group situations.

The script and the associated SGFs were originally written by lightvector and can be downloaded on the
[Computer Go Discord
server](https://discord.com/channels/417022162348802048/459783732182777876/1079124172338368633).

The SGFs originally listed that they used Japanese rules, but they've been
modified to say they use Tromp-Taylor rules without checking that the game and
the labeled correct/wrong moves still make sense under Tromp-Taylor rules. We
did this because Tromp-Taylor is the usual rule set we've used, and we have some
models that have only trained under Tromp-Taylor rules.
